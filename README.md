# Feature-Scaling
Feature scaling adjusts numerical features to a similar scale to prevent certain features from dominating others in machine learning models.

# Types of Feature Scaling 
1. Standard Scaling.
2. Min-Max Scaling.
3. Unit vector.

# Standard Scaling 
Standard scaling (Z-score normalization) adjusts data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

# Min-Max scaling 
Min-Max Scaling scales data to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1, preserving the relative relationships between values.

# Unit Vector
Unit vector scaling normalizes data by dividing each feature vector by its magnitude, resulting in vectors with unit length.
